This is the github repository where I follow the totality of the schoolbook used for the medialogy course, about creating games for Unity using C# 
  I write this before handing in an assignment about the serialization and deserialization of XML and JSON files. 

The relevant files for the assignment is found in the directory 
  \Hero-Born---IKDU-programming-book\Assets\Scripts\SerializationAssignment
